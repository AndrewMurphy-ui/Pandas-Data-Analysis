# My Python Project

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following packages:

- pandas
- openpyxl

You can install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



### **3. In the Python Script Itself**
Inside your **Python file** (e.g., `script.py`), you would just **import** the necessary packages. You **don’t need** to list the packages inside your Python file explicitly—just import them where needed.

#### Example of Python code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import openpyxl

# Your code here
